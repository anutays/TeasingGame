# How to use

1. Start TeasingGame Maker, enter the following parameters: Name program (window title), Author (displayed when the script is run), Size window, Show info (Show initial window when script starts), Name folder (the name of the folder where the files will be stored), Main window opacity, Icon. After that, click Create.

2. Next, we need to define what a scene and an event are. An event is an action that occurs in sequence according to a list. The scene is a storage of events. To add an event to a scene, you need to select the desired scene in the list, choose the desired event and click the Create button.
   
By default, the script starts with the first scene. After all events on the scene are finished, the events on the next scene immediately begin to happen. But if there is a Caption event on the scene, then the scene will switch only when you click on the window, even if all events have already taken place on this scene.
More details about all events below.
